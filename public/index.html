                    I'm a web developer with experience using Javascript, React, SQL, and Node.js. See below for examples of my work, including
                    my personal and group projects.

                    <hr class="clothHr" /> I attended a three month web development program and am familiar with the full-stack development cycle.

        “Voldemort, you’re a very bad and mean wizard,” Harry savagely said. Hermione nodded encouragingly. The tall Death Eater
        was wearing a shirt that said ‘Hermione Has Forgotten How To Dance,’ so Hermione dipped his face in mud. Ron threw
        a wand at Voldemort and everyone applauded. Ron smiled. Ron reached for his wand slowly.

        “Ron’s the handsome one,” Harry muttered as he reluctantly reached for his. They cast a spell or two, and jets of green light
        shot out of the Death Eaters’ heads. Ron flinched. “Not so handsome now,” thought Harry as he dipped Hermione in
        hot sauce. The Death Eaters were dead now, and Harry was hungrier than he’d ever been.
