                Ask five people, and chances are good that you will end up with
                ten different answers. For some, success is rooted in education,
                meaning a child who completes advanced degrees has achieved
                success. For others, practical life skills take precedence. Can
                my child do well for herself? Can she balance a checkbook, write
                up a sound resume, and think critically about her goals?
