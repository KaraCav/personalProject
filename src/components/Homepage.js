              <p>
                Ask five people, and chances are good that you will end up with
                ten different answers. For some, success is rooted in education,
                meaning a child who completes advanced degrees or becomes a
                doctor has achieved success. For others, practical life skills
                take precedence. Can my child do well for herself? Can she
                balance a checkbook, write up a sound resume, and think
                critically about her goals?
              </p>

                â€‹ Our mentoring services are meant to recognize and fill in any
                gaps in knowledge a student may have. We offer a holistic,
                individualized approach to learning that can benefit anyone. Our
                services range from job search assistance, to college transition
                help, to tutoring services for students with a particular
                academic struggle.
