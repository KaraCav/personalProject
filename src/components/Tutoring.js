              At Gateway Mentoring, we understand that every student is coming
              from a different place in their learning. Our mentoring services
              are meant to recognize and fill in any gaps in knowledge a student
              may have. We offer a holistic, individualized approach to learning
              that can benefit anyone. Our services range from job search
              assistance, to college transition help, to tutoring services for
              students with a particular academic struggle.

                From pre-K to post-graduate, our tutors are experienced and
                highly knowledgable. For some, success is rooted in education,
                meaning a child who completes advanced degrees has achieved
                success. For others, practical life skills take precedence. Can
                my child do well for herself? Can she balance a checkbook, write
                up a sound resume, and think critically about her goals?
